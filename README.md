# SkillCraft Internship – Data Science Tasks - Task - 02

This repository contains the task and projects completed as part of the **SkillCraft Data Science Internship**.  


## 🚀 Tasks Overview

### 🔹 Task 1: Bar Chart Visualization
- Created a bar chart using Python.
- Used Matplotlib & Seaborn for plotting.
- Learned the basics of data visualization and customization.

### 🔹 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)
- Performed **EDA on Titanic dataset**.
- Handled missing values:
  - Dropped `Cabin` (too many missing values).
  - Filled `Embarked` using mode.
  - Filled `Age` using median.
- Visualized survival patterns by:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Fare
- Generated a correlation heatmap of numerical features.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Females had higher survival chances.
  - 1st class passengers survived more often than 2nd/3rd class.
  - Higher fare correlated with better survival chances.
